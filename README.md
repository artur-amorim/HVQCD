This is an R package interface to C++ code that solves the holographic models of VQCD proposed by Jarvinen and Kiritsis in arXiv:1112.1261v2. The solution is obtained by solving with respect to the backgrounds of type I defined in the previous reference. The input parameters are x, the fixed ratio between the number of flavours and the number of colours when both are taken to infinity, and tau0 that characterizes the profile of the tachyion in the IR. After providing the parameters the equations of motion are solved by using the Runge-Kutta Dopri5 method. The output of the code are arrays that contain dz/dA, lambda, tau and their derivatives with respect to the warp factor.
